<b>Repository</b>
  
A repository generically refers to a central place where data is stored and maintained. A repository can be a place where multiple databases or files are located for distribution over a network, or a repository can be a location that is directly accessible to the user without having to travel across a network. 

Git is a program that tracks changes made to files. Once installed, Git can be initialized on a project to create a Git
repository. A Git repository is the .git/ folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in your
project, building a history over time.

<b>Clone</b>

The git clone command copies an existing Git repository. This is sort of like SVN checkout, except the “working copy” is a full-fledged Git repository—it has its own history, manages its own files, and is a completely isolated environment from the original repository. 
The "clone" command downloads an existing Git repository [remote] to your local computer.
You will then have a full-blown, local version of that Git repo and can start working on the project.
Typically, the "original" repository is located on a remote server, often from a service like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab). That remote repository's URL is then later referred to as the "origin".

Thie following command will download the project to a folder named after the Git repository ("Mini_Project_1" in this case) <br>
Repository Owner USERNAME: Web_Dev_IS601   <br>
GITHUB REPOSITORY PROJECT: Mini_Project_1 <br>
cd folder/to/clone-into/        ---> Change to the folder on your local directory that will contain the cloned repository <br>
Clone Command**: <br>
<b>git clone </b> https://github.com/Web_Dev_IS601/Mini_Project_1.git   <br><br>
**SSH/HTTPS URL FORMAT :   git@name-of-git-host:username/project-name (SSH version) or [https://name-of-git-host/username/project-name] (HTTPS version).
