#### Objective:
In this project, students were required to work in groups in 2 or 3. A single repository was to be developed between each group. One person was elected to merge  pull requests as the team leader. It is required to have at least 10 substantive commit per group member that are marked "feature". Any fixes to "features" must be marked as fixes and do not count.  Commits for creating files or renaming files or other non-feature work should be named "task".  

Each group must include an explanation of how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company.  Each project must include the following sections,which are listed in the index below (for a group of two members).
